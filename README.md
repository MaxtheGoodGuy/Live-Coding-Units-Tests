# Live-Coding-Units-Tests
Files used in a talk/live-coding I gave at __Epitech Paris__ about __Units Tests__, __Criterion__, __Coverage__, and __TDD__ (__Test Driven Development__).

If you want more examples on how to use __Criterion__ you can look up at __Geographer__'s source code from one of his talks.

# USAGE

#### Go into the right folder then you got two choices :

* __make__ : build and exec tests made "by hand".

* __make tests_run__ : build and exec units tests made with Criterion.

# live_coding

Files used and created __during the live-coding__.

# live_coding_test

Files used and created __ahead of the live-coding__.

# ppt
